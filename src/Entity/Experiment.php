 *    - form: An array of entity form classes keyed by their operation.
 *  - entity_keys: Specifies the class properties in which unique keys are
 *    stored for this entity type. Unique keys are properties which you know
 *    will be unique, and which the entity manager can use as unique in database
 *    queries.
 *  - links: entity URL definitions. These are mostly used for Field UI.
 *    Arbitrary keys can set here. For example, User sets cancel-form, while
 *    Node uses delete-form.
